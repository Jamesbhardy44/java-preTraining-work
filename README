NOTE: The titles of the files with main java logic are mostly titled ExampleOne.

I wrote this code, but because I wrote this code when I was brand new to the java environment, I did not follow proper naming conventions. 

In a collaborative dev environment, I  would be sure to use proper naming conventions for my files. 

The folders are named correctly; however, so you should be able to locate what you want to see.

Thanks for stopping by!
